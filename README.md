## General Info
The subject of this page is a task list. In the center of the page is an application to create a task list, which contains two elements: 
1. A form with a field for typing a task and an "Add Task" button.
2. A task list dynamically created from the form with two options available: 
- marking the task as completed and thereby crossing out its text
- removing the task from the task list. 
## Technologies
Project is created with:
- BEM

## Status
The site is dynamically growing, along with the new front-end programming skills I'm learning.
## Inspiration
This website is inspired by the course "Frontend Developer from the Basics" by the online programming school YouCode.
